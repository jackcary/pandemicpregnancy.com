#### Does being pregnant put me at a higher risk of severe illness?

<p class="m-3"></p>

Maybe. 

The CDC has recently added pregnant people to their [list of those who are at higher risk for severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html), although to date, the limited COVID-19 data is inconclusive.

#### Can the virus be transmitted to my baby in utero?

<p class="m-3"></p>

There is not yet substantial evidence of COVID-19 transmission in utero, but a [newborn has tested positive for elevated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763853) shortly after birth.

#### Should I consider a home birth instead of a hospital birth?

<p class="m-3"></p>

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists believes that [hospitals and accredited birth centers are the safest settings for birth](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/04/planned-home-birth). Contact your healthcare provider before making any changes to your birth plan.

#### Can the virus be passed to my baby after delivery?

<p class="m-3"></p>

Yes.  The virus can spread to newborns in the same way it spreads in adults--through droplets in the air and on surfaces.

#### Has COVID-19 been detected in breastmilk?

<p class="m-3"></p>

Not yet.

According to one study of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women, [amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30360-3/fulltext).

#### Will my spouse/partner/friend/family be allowed in the delivery room?

<p class="m-3"></p>

Healthcare facilities are rapidly changing their visitor policies to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Some hospitals are limiting delivery support to one person only; others have even harsher restrictions. If your support person has symptoms or has had recent contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19, it is unlikely they will be allowed in the delivery room with you. Contact your healthcare provider to find out their latest visitor/support policies.
