### Does being pregnant put me at a higher risk of severe illness?

Possibly. The CDC has recently added pregnant people to their [list of those who are at higher risk for severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html), although to date, the limited COVID-19 data is inconclusive.

Pregnant people are at a higher risk of severe illness with similar respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS and MERS).

### How can I stay healthy and manage my stress and anxiety?

To prevent the spread of coronavirus, you should wash your hands often, cough into your elbow, refrain from touching your face, keep a safe distance from others, and stay home if you can.

To stay healthy and manage stress, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [recommends](https://www.acog.org/patient-resources/faqs/pregnancy/coronavirus-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding#how%20can%20I%20stay%20physically%20healthy%20right%20now) eating healthy foods, exercising, getting plenty of sleep, taking breaks from the COVID-19 news and social media, and staying connected with friends and family via phone or online.

### Can the virus be transmitted to my baby in utero?

There is not yet substantial evidence of COVID-19 transmission in utero, but a newborn has tested positive for [elevated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763853) shortly after birth.

### Should I consider a home birth instead of a hospital birth?

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists believes that hospitals and accredited birth centers are the [safest settings for birth](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/04/planned-home-birth). Contact your health care provider before making any changes to your birth plan.

### Can the virus be passed to my baby after delivery?

Yes. The virus can spread to newborns in the same way it spreads in adults--through droplets in the air and on surfaces.

### Has COVID-19 been detected in breastmilk?

Not yet. According to one [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30360-3/fulltext) of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women, amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.

### Will my spouse/partner/family be allowed in the delivery room?

Healthcare facilities are rapidly changing their visitor policies to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Some hospitals and state health departments are [limiting delivery support](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/doh_covid19_obpedsvisitation_032720.pdf) to one person only; others have harsher restrictions. If your support person has symptoms or has had recent contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19, it is unlikely they will be allowed in the delivery room with you. Contact your health care provider to find out their latest visitor/support policies.

###  How will social distancing impact my childbirth classes?

Be prepared to go virtual. Like most group meetings, childbirth prep classes have started moving online through video conferencing software.  For those without reliable internet access or with slow internet speeds, many video conferencing applications do allow you to dial into group calls using your home or mobile phone.  Contact your childbirth class provider to see if this is an option for you.  They may even be able to mail you printed copies of all class materials.

### Will my hospital have the resources to care for my baby and me?

Research and data gathering in progress.

### How many pregnant people have tested positive?

Research and data gathering in progress.

### How many pregnant people have died from COVID-19?

Research and data gathering in progress.

### How many newborns have tested positive?

Research and data gathering in progress.

### How many newborns have died from COVID-19?

At this time, there is not enough data available to accurately answer this question. Reported deaths in infants who have tested positive with COVID-19 are, to date, rare.  There has been at least one [COVID-19-related infant death in Wuhan, China](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2005073), and one recent COVID-19-related infant death in Illinois, USA.

### Will my labor be medically induced if I test positive for COVID-19?

Research and data gathering in progress.

### Will I have to have a C-section if I test positive for COVID-19?

Research and data gathering in progress. There is currently no clear [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196655?mod=article_inline) whether cesarean delivery prevents vertical transmission at the time of delivery.

### Will I be immediately isolated from my baby if I test positive for COVID-19?

It will depend on the current COVID-19 policies and protocols at your health care facility.  The World Health Organization (WHO) states that [close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-pregnancy-childbirth-and-breastfeeding) and that, with good respiratory hygiene, skin-to-skin contact, and room sharing should be supported.
