### Hello!
I'm Jack Cary, a software consultant in [Burlington, Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont).  My wife Chelsea, a doctor of physical therapy (DPT), is currently 33 weeks pregnant!

We know we are not alone in having a ton of questions concerning the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant people, or in our frustration with the lack of comprehensive information.

I've put this website together to gather and share the [questions](/) we've had, and the [information](/resources/) we've found thus far.  The goal of this website is to help pregnant people and their families reset expectations in the time of COVID-19.

If you have a creditable source of information that would contribute to the goal of this project, please send an email to <a class="" href="mailto:hello@pandemicpregnancy.com">hello@pandemicpregnancy.com</a>.

Congratulations on your Pandemic Pregnancy, we are in this together!
